Greenbacks
==========

Greenbacks shows an intersection between a bill acceptor and an
Arduino micro-controller.


Background
----------

A bill acceptor is a small module that processes US paper currency
($1, $5, $10, etc.) and ensures that it's valid. You'll typically find
these in vending machines. Whenever you feed the vending machine a $1
for a bag of chips, the bill acceptor ensures that you're giving it
real currency and then tells the rest of the machine how much credit 
you now have to make a purchase.


Hardware
--------

For this project, the hardware is a Pyramid Technologies
APEX-5400-SN1-USA bill acceptor and an Arduino Uno.


Communications
--------------

The APEX-5000 series bill acceptors have a number of different ways of
communicating the type of bill accepted. In this case, the bill
acceptor is configured to send 10 50 millisecond pulses per dollar. A
$1 bill will cause 10 pulses to be sent while a $5 bill will cause 50
to be sent.
